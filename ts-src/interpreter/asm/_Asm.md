# Assembler interpreter

Please not that files postfixed `Lexer.ts` or `Parser.ts` have been generated by ANTLR directly from a grammar file.

- `AssemblerLexer.ts` has been converted to valid TypeScript syntax for use as a reference.
- `AssemblerParser.ts.x` has only partly been converted at this point.
- `BytecodeAssembler.ts.x` is also the original Java file untouched

# Interpreter Stack machine

Interpreter using a stack based execution engine (using Assembler/Bytecode)

## Incomplete

Currently the `Interpreter.ts` needs work. The `FileInputStream` could be swapped with the `readFile` function used elsewhere to read in a string (or `InputStream`).

The `CommonTokenStream` should be based on the ANTLR class of the same name.
